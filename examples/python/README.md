This folder contains Python-versions of the examples in the assignment. If you are interested in learning how ParaView can be used from Python, you can look at the code and try to run the scripts either via the command line tool pvpython (included with ParaView), or from the Python shell in the ParaView GUI. Note that some of the scripts currently only display correctly with pvpython.
